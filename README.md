# Lightning Creations Core War League

## How to submit
Create a folder for your files and pu in your warriors. Then, add them to the "newWarriors.txt" file so that we can add them to the hill.

## Hill rules
If you wish to submit a new version of your warrior, you must include it under a new filename so that the existing one stays in the hill. Warriors start at the first empty slot in the hill and battle the warrior above them in the hill until they lose or draw, where they will stay on the hill until challenged by another warrior. The warrior at the top of the hill is the "King of the Hill" and is the reigning champion.
